## Study Order

1. Networking refresh  
2. Authentication & access control  
3. Cryptography basics  
4. Application security  
5. Operations & incident response

## Resources

- **Anki**: Spaced repetition for key terms, port numbers, and acronyms.  
- **Udemy Security+ course**: Full video lectures and quizzes to reinforce weak areas.  
- Practice exams: Critical for timing, pattern recognition, and identifying gaps.

## Takeaway

Layer your study: concepts first, repetition with Anki, reinforcement with a structured course, and final polish with timed practice exams.
