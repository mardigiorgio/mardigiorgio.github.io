## Overview

WiPi Guardian is an in-progress wireless IDS tailored to Raspberry Pi deployments.
A Scapy-based sniffer ingests 802.11 beacons, deauthentication, and disassociation frames, normalizes channel/band metadata, and batches them into a SQLite database for later analysis.
The sensor loop analyzes recent events, flagging deauthentication floods scoped to a defended SSID and issuing rogue‑AP alerts when BSSIDs, channels, bands, or RSN capabilities deviate from policy.
Alerts can be pushed to Discord or sent via SMTP, enabling remote notification.
A FastAPI service exposes REST endpoints for health, overview counts, event queries, and policy updates, plus an SSE stream for near real‑time alert delivery and optional static UI hosting.
The Svelte/Tailwind frontend shows live stats, lets you edit defense rules, and displays incoming alerts through the SSE channel

### Features

- Scapy-based 802.11 frame capture with channel/band inference and RSN parsing
- Scoped deauthentication flood detection with cooldown and offender tracking
- Rogue‑AP detection using BSSID/channel/band allowlists and RSN baselines
- Discord webhook and SMTP email alerting modules
- FastAPI backend with REST + SSE and optional static dashboard hosting
- Svelte/Tailwind UI for overview metrics, defense configuration, and live alert stream
