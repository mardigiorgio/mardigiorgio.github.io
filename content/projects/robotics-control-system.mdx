## What it does

Provides a modular drive chassis with PID tuning, field‑centric odometry, and a touchscreen interface to choose autonomous routines before a match.

## Features

- Drive class sets up left/right motor groups, inertial sensor, and optional tracking wheels.
- Tunable PID loops for distance, turn, heading, and swing motions.
- Odom module maintains X/Y field coordinates using tracking wheel feedback.
- Pre‑auton screen lets you tap to cycle between test routines (drive, turn, odometry, full path).
- Driver control helpers for arcade, tank, and holonomic drive styles.

```cpp
Drive chassis(
    TANK_ONE_ROTATION,
    motor_group(BLMotor, FLMotor, MLMotor),
    motor_group(BRMotor, FRMotor, MRMotor),
    PORT16,  // inertial sensor port
    3.08,    // wheel diameter (in)
    2.5,     // external gear ratio
    360,     // gyro scale
    PORT1, -PORT2, PORT3, -PORT4,      // drive motor ports (sign sets direction)
    PORT5, 2.75, 1,                    // forward tracking wheel: port, diameter, offset
    PORT5, 2.75, 5.2                   // sideways tracking wheel: port, diameter, offset
);
```
